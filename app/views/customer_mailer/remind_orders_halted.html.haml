Hi #{@customer.first_name.strip},
%br
%br
#{@oops}, your recent order won't be fulfilled until your account is above your minimum balance - your existing account balance is
%strong= @customer.account.balance
(your account should always be above your minimum balance of #{@customer.balance_threshold} in order to receive deliveries).
%br
%br
%center
  = link_to "Please make a payment", new_customer_session_url(distributor: @distributor.parameter_name)
  or contact #{@distributor.name}.
%br
If you've recently made a payment, it may not have shown up yet - take a look at your account statement in the next few days to check. 
%br
%br
Thanks.
